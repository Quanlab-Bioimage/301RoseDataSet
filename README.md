# 301RoseDataSet
**we collected Gram-stained bacteria images from lower respiratory tract specimens of patients with lung infections in Chinese PLA General Hospital obtained by M-ROSE from 2018 to 2022 and desensitized these images to produce 1705 images (4,912 Ã— 3,684 pixels). A total of 4,833 cocci and 6,991 bacilli were manually labelled and differentiated into negative and positive. In addition, we further benchmark the network and construct a cascade detection and semantic segmentation network that achieves over 85% accuracy for the recognition of both positive/negative cocci and positive/negative bacilli. Data and benchmark algorithms we provided that may benefit the study of automated bacterial identification in clinical specimens.**
## DataSet
https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10474234
## DataSet specification
* BigPic: Total 1705 pieces of raw big data.
* DeepDataSet:Select some data from the original big picture data to verify the quality of the dataset.
* 640DataSet:Selected some large maps from the original large data, cut them into 640 sizes, manually marked the detection box, and segmented the data.
* DetectionDataSet: Converts 640 data sets to detection data sets suitable for YoloV5 networks.
* SplitDataSet: Transforms 640 datasets into split datasets suitable for Unet networks
  
  G-cocci: 3371<br>
  G+cocci: 1462<br>
  G-bacilli: 5799<br>
  G+bacilli: 1192<br>

## Object detection
**The effect of target detection network recognition is as follows: 0 represents negative cocci, 1 represents positive cocci, 2 represents negative bacilli and 2 represents positive bacilli.**

## Semantic segmentation
**The effect of the segmentation network is as follows, with red representing positive bacteria and green representing negative bacteria.**
